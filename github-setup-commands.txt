# GitHub Setup Commands for Your Portfolio

# 1. First, create a new repository on GitHub.com:
#    - Go to github.com
#    - Click "New repository" 
#    - Name it "portfolio" or "my-portfolio"
#    - Make it PUBLIC (for GitHub Pages)
#    - Don't initialize with README (you'll add your own)

# 2. Open PowerShell in your portfolio folder and run these commands:

# Initialize git repository
git init

# Add all files to staging
git add .

# Make your first commit
git commit -m "Initial portfolio commit with chess timer, AI chatbot, and drawing pad"

# Add your GitHub repository as remote (replace YOUR_USERNAME with your GitHub username)
git remote add origin https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/portfolio.git

# Push to GitHub
git push -u origin main

# If you get an error about 'master' vs 'main', run this first:
git branch -M main

# Then try the push command again
git push -u origin main
